A study looking at the specifics of On-Star (and competing products) data gathering, transmission and storing procedures. What do they collect; how do they handle/protect the data they save; what *can* they do with user data? After this, we'll have a feasibility study to see if we want to make a talk out of this for infosec/privacy cons.
